        <p>Mathematics is the study of numbers, shapes and patterns. The word comes from the Greek word "μάθημα" (máthema),
             meaning "science, knowledge, or learning", and is sometimes shortened to maths (in England, Australia, Ireland,
              and New Zealand) or math (in the United States and Canada).[1] The short words are often used for arithmetic, 
              geometry or algebra by students and their schools.
