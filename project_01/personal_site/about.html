            <h3>Hiking</h3>
            

                <p>
                When I am not coding you can probably find me out with the family, enjoying nature, trying to find our next favorite hiking spot.
                I love breathing in the fresh air and just being outside. There are so many benefits that come from going on hikes, that I try to
                recommend it to anyone that will listen.

            <h3>Sports</h3>
                <p>
                    Sports have been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember. Some of my earliest memories that I have are from playing on 
                    the soccer, basketball, or baseball field as a little kid. Not only are playing sports fun, but there are also plenty of life lessons 
                    that one can learn from playing as well.
